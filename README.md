## About:

This is a concept of a minimalist and non-responsive website that allows user to discover trending movies, look for films among many genres and search out movies by title in **[The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/)**. The purpose of the project was to train technologies know to me so far and get me more familiar with some new concepts like working with APIs etc.
